For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States has a specific definition, which focuses on substantial limitations in major life activities.  Other countries, like the UK, have their own legislation (e.g., Equality Act 2010) with different criteria.  These definitions often include a consideration of whether reasonable accommodations could mitigate the impairment.\n> \n> * **Medical definitions:** Medical professionals may use different diagnostic criteria and classifications based on specific conditions and their impact on a person's functioning.  These definitions may not always align perfectly with legal definitions.\n> \n> * **Social model of disability:** This model emphasizes the societal barriers and environmental limitations that create disability, rather than focusing solely on the individual's impairment.  This perspective highlights how social structures and attitudes can significantly impact a person's ability to participate fully in society.\n> \n> Therefore, there's no single, universally accepted definition.  The determination of whether someone is disabled depends on the specific legal, medical, or social framework being used.
